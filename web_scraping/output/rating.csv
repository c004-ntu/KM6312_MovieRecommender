5b6964e1925141404f0d1094,daisyrowley,19995-avatar,Avatar,0,2018-08-07,"Avatar is an overwhelming, immersive spectacle. The state-of-the-art 3D technology draws us in, but it is the vivid weirdness of Cameron\'s luridly imagined tropical other world that keeps us fascinated. I like this film and I have written many review for essay writing service. The special effects are so good here that you don\'t even notice them. It is eerie how Cameron has made it look and feel like he is just pointing a camera at the action.",/u/daisyrowley,/review/5b6964e1925141404f0d1094,0
5ea448e4bdc34c0020261327,John+Chard,19995-avatar,Avatar,0,2020-04-25,"It\'s cinema Jim, but not as we know it. So here it is then, what has been in gestation in James Cameron\'s mind for over 12 years finally hit the silver screen towards the back end of 2009. Made for gazillions amount of cash, Avatar went on to make a billion trillion in Worldwide receipts-and this before the rush rush release of DVD/BLU RAY sales are factored into the equation. The film, and all its technical wizardry, is quite simply a gargantuan piece of cinematic history. Released in 2d and 3d, and probably some other format that I\'m forgetting, every advanced tool of the trade has been utilised by Cameron and his team to create what is now the ultimate popcorn blockbuster. Shame then, that away from the visual extravaganza the film is as shallow as this review will ultimately end up being. No doubt about it, this is a joy for the eyes and ears, the minuscule details are wonderful and the colour positively pings from every frame. But in the eagerness to create such splendour they forgot to put any substance into the writing. This is plot simplicity. And even its messages, as Cameron smugly preaches his sermon from the pulpit, now seem old hat. Do we really need another boink over the head about eco invasion? Or a curt reminder of American infiltration into some land where motives are suspicious at best? No we don\'t really do we? Worse still is some of the dialogue, which quite frankly could have come from some playground encounter as the kiddies play kiss chase or bang bang your dead army. There\'s also a sense of familiarity with other better scripted film\'s, Dances cough With cough Wolves cough It\'s as if Cameron just knew that narrative structure wasn\'t as important as having the expensive gimmicks. He\'s like a modern day William Castle-only with considerably more readies at his disposal. The cast are OK, Zoe Saldana puts a sexy feistiness to her blue alien Neytiri, Sam Worthington keeps the humanistic elements just about above water, while Sigourney Weaver is as ever the consummate professional. But ironically, in a film shimmering bright in 2d & 3d, the characters are all one dimensional. None more so than Stephen \'The Party Crasher\' Lang\'s Colonel. A man so gruff and gung-ho menacing he really ought to be in Sly Stallone\'s upcoming testo movie The Expendables. Nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, it won three, for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction. Those were richly deserved. They also tell us all we need to now about Cameron\'s Behemoth. 5/10",/u/John+Chard,/review/5ea448e4bdc34c0020261327,0

665b794d23eddc5f70d7f4db,Geronimo1967,19995-avatar,Avatar,0,2024-06-01,"This is another of these films for which I didn\'t get the memo. It undoubtedly has parallels with the ecological ravaging of Earth by mankind, but for the most part it is just a fairly standard action romance that owes much of it\'s significance to it being an outstanding technical production. Sam Worthington is \'Jake\', a paraplegic solider who is tasked with assisting on a mission on a distant planet. By way of a bribe, the authorities offer him surgery to restore his mobility if he uses an avatar machine to infiltrate the folks inhabiting the planet \'Pandora\'. The more he explores this bright new world, the more he begins to integrate with the people and their beautiful and colourful environment. His affection for \'Neytiri\' (Zoe Saldana) and his gradually developing appreciation of just what his mission is about, sets him up for a serious conflict with the gung-ho militaristic \'Quaritch\' (Stephen Lang). This film is all about corporate greed and an horrendous disregard not just for nature, but for an indigenous population that is though frequently touching, let down by a really mediocre cast, some slightly pontificating dialogue and yes, it is really too long. It is great to look at, the standards of the production mixing reality with animation are outstanding; it\'s just that the story is just all a bit lightweight.",/u/Geronimo1967,/review/665b794d23eddc5f70d7f4db,0
5cbf94670e0a266b96fba5ef,garethmb,299534-avengers-endgame,Avengers: Endgame,0,2019-04-23,"The epic Marvel Saga that started over ten years ago has been building up to the inevitable clash with the powerful tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin).  Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived. Picking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. As time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible. Inspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all. What follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right. The film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments. This all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.
The film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed. It is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way. As this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; “Avengers: End Game” is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits. 4.5 stars out of 5",/u/garethmb,/review/5cbf94670e0a266b96fba5ef,0
5cc07fa00e0a2615fdf464d3,Ruuz,299534-avengers-endgame,Avengers: Endgame,0,2019-04-24,"Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, \'cause it\'s after 1 o\'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see Endgame again. Putting it out there right from the get-go, Avengers: Endgame is my favourite MCU movie. It\'s my favourite movie of the year too, but I\'ve only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can\'t say it\'s perfect, there\'s some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn\'t seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it\'s not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing. I will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise\'s 21 movies preceding this point, then Endgame is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It\'s the end of Infinity War but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters. To me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in three years . Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it.",/u/Ruuz,/review/5cc07fa00e0a2615fdf464d3,0
5cc307bfc3a36809ab86e2fd,msbreviews,299534-avengers-endgame,Avengers: Endgame,0,2019-04-26,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :) Don\'t worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I\'m writing this sentence, I\'m still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it\'s such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I\'m extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I\'m obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). However, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don\'t think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It\'s epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It\'s pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings\' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don\'t expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that\'s going to make you pretty much either \'love\' or \'like\' this movie. I absolutely love it! This is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can\'t deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don\'t have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos\' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there. Some people didn\'t really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn\'t work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won\'t know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who\'ve lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves. The humor is mostly on-point, but it\'s still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act\'s tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn\'t expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue. Visually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can\'t wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It\'s just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I\'m listening to it right now as I\'m writing this review, and I\'m getting chills all over my body. I can\'t really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson\'s, Evans\', and Robert Downey Jr\'s (Tony Stark / Iron Man). “New” characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don\'t judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors\' minds in the first place! All in all, I don\'t know what to do now. The only thing I\'m sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn\'t fall asleep properly because I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It\'s everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It\'s that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can\'t even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we\'ll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame! PS: it\'s not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn\'t exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn\'t everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don’t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame … And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life! Rating: A+",/u/msbreviews,/review/5cc307bfc3a36809ab86e2fd,0

5cd7cf4ec3a3681d16c096ba,Dark+Jedi,299534-avengers-endgame,Avengers: Endgame,0,2019-05-12,"These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame. I have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect. It was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel. The movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory. I was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character. I was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed. There were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it. There were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards. Anyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.",/u/Dark+Jedi,/review/5cd7cf4ec3a3681d16c096ba,0

How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in \'Infinity War\' weren’t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I’ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of \'Back to the Future II\' (1989). “Endgame” (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film. Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff’s edge, and much more. Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can’t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull.

Potential Spoilers. 1. Story . Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story. The story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na\'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don\'t belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro). 2. Characters . Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.
Spidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can’t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin’ Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. 3. Acting . Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don’t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age. 4. Everything tied together . A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don’t need to say more.",/u/gaitanoayieko%40gmail.com,/review/63a004878ddc3414aa020acf,0

It’s a James Cameron film, so it’s impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na’vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na’vi learns to be ocean Na’vi and then fight Stephen Lang. But the new movie also focuses on a group of annoying teens that constantly get themselves in trouble and peril over and over again throughout the much too long 3+ hour runtime and sidelining better, more established characters. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original at every turn. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that’s all it is.",/u/mooney240,/review/639c14af0752880093558e1c,0

Now with four children and their human friend \'Spider\' (Jack Champion - remember Johnny Sheffield?), they are living life to the full. Until, that is, one night they see a new star in the sky. Star? Well, no - it\'s the ships announcing the return of the human beings, this time even more bent on the conquest of their planet now that the Earth is finally on it\'s knees. Armed to the hilt with the latest technology and weaponry, and commanded by the essence of the departed \'Col. Quaritch\' - who also now leads a squad of Na\'vi-esque avatars of his own - things look ominous for the \'Sully\' family. Realising that they are front and centre for their persecutors, they relocate to (saddle themselves on) a remote, water-based community where they hope, rather unrealistically, to be able to sit it out... This is undoubtedly a beautiful piece of cinema to watch. 3D and IMAX with a classily crafted score from Simon Franglen and a message that trumpets the cruciality of the symbiotic relationships between all creatures that live on a world where co-operation and understanding are vital to the survival of all. Thing is, though, that all of that glorious cinematography starts to get just a bit repetitive after about an hour and the middle portion of this really does drag. Indeed, were this to have been a long \'Blue Planet\' style documentary alerting us to the dangers of mankind\'s rampant abuse of resources with scant regard to the implications for any other species, then I would have enjoyed it better in three parts with Sir David Attenborough\'s mellifluous narration. It isn\'t though, and the story is stretched so terribly thinly that - sorry, sacrilege I know - I was actually bored a bit. It does pick up for the last forty minutes or so as the denouement provides for loads of action-packed pyrotechnics but to be honest, I had sort of lost interest by that point. Certainly, it is a great looking film that offers us food for thought, but as a story - I thought it weak, predictable and at times it does just a little too much of it\'s own recycling. Indeed - had their children actually done what they were told in the first place, there might not have been much of a story at all!

It\'s like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn\'t matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997. You jump - I jump. Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it\'s true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack\'s story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure. Never let go. So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society\'s class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It\'s what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10",/u/John+Chard,/review/5424aaccc3a36808760043df,0
62a08f2e12197e565ea45214,Geronimo1967,597-titanic,Titanic,0,2022-06-08,"Set around the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS \'Titanic\', this is essentially a film in two parts. The first, weaker, element features a young \'Dawson\' (Leonardo DiCaprio) who wins a third class ticket to New York on the soon to depart liner. Meantime, the wealthy but unhappy \'Rose\' (Kate Winslet) is up in the posh cabins with her cold and unfeeling fiancée \'Hockley\' (Billy Zane) and her equally unpleasant, venally ambitious mother \'Ruth\' (Frances Fisher). Desperately unhappy, \'Rose\' considers jumping off the prow of the boat, but luckily the charming young \'Dawson\' is on hand to talk her down, and so begins their friendship that causes much chagrin amongst her socially elite companions. That friendship culminates in him making a rather provocative drawing of her, the final straw for her boyfriend and his enforcer \'Lovejoy\' (David Warner). It all looks ominous for both until - part two begins. The ship, speeding along nicely under the command of Bernard Hill\'s Captain Smith clips the underwater part of an iceberg and now history takes over. James Cameron offers us a purely speculative account of what might have happened as the initially incredulous crew start to realise that maybe it is not just Molly Brown (an excellent Kathy Bates) that\'s unsinkable! What now ensues are a series of well staged scenarios depicting panic, fear, a fair degree of selfishness and some proper stiff upper lips as the ship has be evacuated and the segregation of the passengers and competencies of the crew start to become life threatening. The visual effects have dated, the smoke from the ship\'s funnels blows in an strangely symmetrical fashion and the later scenes struggle to convince - but this is really a rather tragic love story with a strong chemistry between the engaging two characters at the top of the bill, and an effective performance from the older \'Rose\' (Gloria Stewart) who takes on the role of narrator 80 years after the disaster. I still find it uncomfortable to watch the actuality of the wreck, which features occasionally throughout the film - I feel like I am quite literally walking through someone\'s grave; but it does lend a potent hook upon which this lengthy, but well thought out and constructed drama is presented. Criticisms have been made of it\'s factual inaccuracies, and it may well play a bit fast and loose with some of the real characterisations - but it\'s a drama, and to be enjoyed has to be appreciated in that sphere. Big screen is a must, it really does lose a great deal on a television.",/u/Geronimo1967,/review/62a08f2e12197e565ea45214,0

63ef88b95cc11d0086123924,TitanGusang,597-titanic,Titanic,0,2023-02-17,"Titanic is simply a masterpiece. This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here. Before I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch. Back to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me. The performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet\'s chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton. This film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well. Overall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it. Score: 96%  
Verdict: Masterpiece On a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",/u/TitanGusang,/review/63ef88b95cc11d0086123924,0
