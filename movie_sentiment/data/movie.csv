The movie\'s introduction is a type of music video for Jackson\'s \'Man in the Mirror\' but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael\'s career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled \'Badder\', followed by sections \'Speed Demon\' and \'Leave Me Alone\'. What follows is the biggest section where Michael plays a hero with magical powers and saves three children from Mr. Big.
